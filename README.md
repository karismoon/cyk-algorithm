# Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) Algorithm

## Overview

The Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm is a dynamic programming method used to determine whether a given string belongs to the language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The algorithm works by systematically constructing a table that represents possible derivations of substrings of the input string from non-terminals in the CFG.

## Chomsky Normal Form Conversion

### Overview

Before applying the CYK algorithm, the CFG must be in CNF. 

For the CFG to be in CNF, all production rules must one of of the following forms:

1. Two non-terminals
2. One terminal
3. Start symbol allowed only if the start symbol can generate the empty string.

### Steps

**1. Augment the Grammar**

Add a new start symbol  and a rule , where  is the original start symbol. This ensures that the start symbol never appears on the right-hand side of any production.

Example:
```
Before:
  S -> AB | ε

After:
  S0 -> S
  S -> AB | ε
```

**2. Eliminate Epsilon-Productions**

Remove all productions of the form , except for the start symbol if necessary. Update other productions to account for nullable variables.

Example:
```
Before:
  S -> AB | ε
  A -> a | ε

After:
  S -> AB | B | A
  A -> a
```

**3. Eliminate Unit Productions**

Remove unit productions of the form , where both  and  are non-terminals, and replace them with the productions of .

Example:
```
Before:
  S -> A
  A -> a

After:
  S -> a
```

**4. Remove Mixed Productions**

Replace productions where terminals and non-terminals appear together (e.g., ) with new non-terminals for the terminals.

Example:
```
Before:
  S -> ABc

After:
  S -> ABT
  T -> c
```

**5. Enforce Binary Productions**

Convert rules with more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side into binary productions using new non-terminals.

Example:
```
Before:
  S -> ABC

After:
  S -> ABT
  T -> C
```

## Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) Algorithm

## Conclusion

The CYK algorithm, coupled with the conversion of CFGs into Chomsky Normal Form, provides a robust method for determining membership in context-free languages. By leveraging a dynamic programming approach, the algorithm systematically constructs derivations for substrings, ensuring both efficiency and clarity.
